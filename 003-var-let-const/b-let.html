    LET

    Watch everyhting in the console.
    <p>
      In this code, there are two variables named "a" and "b." The "a" inside
      the if block is declared using let, which limits its scope to the block,
      whereas the "b" inside the if block is declared using var, which has
      function-level scope. This leads to different values being assigned to
      these variables within and outside the if block.

    <script>
      var a = 5;
      var b = 10;

      if (a === 5) {
        let a = 4; // The scope is within the if block
        var b = 1; // The scope is within the function

        console.log(a); // 4
        console.log(b); // 1
      }

      console.log(a); // 5
      console.log(b); // 1
